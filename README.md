# Running WordPress on AWS Free Tier: Simplified Guide using Terraform

In today's digital era, establishing an online presence is crucial for businesses, bloggers, and enthusiasts alike. Hosting a website can be costly, but with the availability of cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), it's possible to run a WordPress site on a single server at minimal cost. In this guide, we'll explore how to achieve this using AWS's free tier, leveraging open-source tools and automation for a streamlined setup.

AWS Free Tier Benefits
AWS offers a generous free tier package, enabling users to explore its services without incurring charges. By taking advantage of the AWS free tier, you can host your WordPress website economically while benefiting from AWS's robust infrastructure.

Inspiration from a Detailed Blog
My approach to setting up WordPress on a single server instance was heavily influenced by an insightful blog post - "Hosting WordPress and MariaDB using AWS".

Requirements
To embark on this journey of hosting WordPress on a single free tier AWS server, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

AWS Account: Sign up for an AWS account if you haven't already. This will grant you access to AWS's suite of services, including EC2 for hosting your WordPress instance.

Budget Setup: Set up a budget in your AWS Billing Dashboard to monitor your spending. Configure alerts for expenditures exceeding $5 to ensure cost control and avoid unexpected charges.

Terraform Installed: Terraform serves as our infrastructure as code tool for automating the deployment of AWS resources. Install Terraform on your local machine by following the official documentation for your operating system.

Git Installed: Git facilitates version control and collaboration. Ensure Git is installed on your system to clone the necessary Terraform configuration files from my repo.

Install and Configuring AWS CLI:Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine following the official AWS CLI documentation tailored to your operating system.Once installed, configure the AWS CLI with your AWS credentials using the following command:

aws configure
With these requirements in place, you're ready to embark on your journey of hosting WordPress on AWS, inspired by Akshaya insightful blog post.

Cloning the GitHub Repository
Clone the GitHub repository containing the Terraform configuration files required for deploying WordPress on AWS. This repository simplifies the migration process by providing pre-configured Terraform scripts.

Ensure you have Git installed on your system, then clone the repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordpress-aws-free-one-ec2.git cd wordpress-aws-free-one-ec2
Running Terraform
Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform files and initialize Terraform:

terraform init

Review the Terraform plan to ensure accuracy:

terraform plan
Apply the Terraform configuration to provision the necessary AWS resources:

terraform apply
This process will deploy the WordPress infrastructure on AWS, including a single EC2 instance housing both WordPress and the database. Be patient, the deployment can take up to 10 minutes before you can access the WordPress URL.

Accessing WordPress
Once the Terraform deployment is complete, access your WordPress website by navigating to the public IP address of the EC2 instance in your web browser.

Now you can continue and install WordPress.

Summary
Hosting WordPress on a single server instance within AWS's free tier is now within your grasp. Leveraging Terraform alongside AWS's free tier, you can host your WordPress website cost-effectively while enjoying the reliability of AWS's infrastructure.

Disclaimer and Caution:

Before proceeding with the deployment of resources on AWS, it's crucial to acknowledge and understand potential risks and costs associated with cloud services. While this guide aims to facilitate the setup of a WordPress website on AWS's free tier, it's essential to exercise caution and responsibility.

Cost Considerations: Utilizing cloud services, even within the free tier, may result in charges if certain limits are exceeded or additional resources are utilized. Always be mindful of the resources you provision and regularly monitor your usage to avoid unexpected costs. As the author of this guide, I cannot be held responsible for any unforeseen expenses incurred during the usage of AWS services.

Cleanup and Resource Management: After completing the setup, it's crucial to perform cleanup actions to avoid ongoing charges. You can terminate the EC2 instance and associated resources by running appropriate commands with Terraform. Ensure that you follow AWS best practices for resource cleanup to prevent unnecessary charges.

Budget Monitoring: To further mitigate the risk of unexpected costs, consider setting up a budget alert within the AWS Billing Dashboard. This feature allows you to define a budget threshold and receive email notifications if your expenditure approaches or exceeds the specified limit. Setting a budget alert provides an additional layer of financial oversight and helps prevent inadvertent overspending.

By exercising diligence, regularly monitoring resource usage, and implementing appropriate budget controls, you can enjoy the benefits of AWS services while minimizing financial risks. Remember, responsible cloud usage is key to maximizing the value of cloud computing resources.
